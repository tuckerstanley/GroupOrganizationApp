# GroupOrganizationApp

Tucker Stanley (tws76) and Ethan Stanley (ehs86)

This is a web application that allows users to join a house forum, and view/add reminders, events, and chores. The intended audience is college students in large houses or organizations.

We have not deployed our site yet, so you will need to run it on your local server. In order to run the frontend please type "yarn frontend", in order to deploy the backend please type `yarn server`, to run both concurrently, please type `yarn start`. You will need to do this in order to post to the database from the frontend.

We spent a long time making the project ready to deploy, however were unsuccesful in doing so. The version of code that is intended to be deployed to Heroku can be found in the ehs86/Heroku branch. We put the code that runs locally on the github though.

When making a post into our house forum, please click the make post button. Make sure that you put the type as either "Event", "Chore", or "Reminder" in order for it to be displayed in our columns, because those are the types that we display. To view the post, click "View" next to a post and it will show the post. Remember that any post you make will be associated with your user, so don't make a post that you don't want to!
