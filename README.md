When making a post into our house forum, please click the make post button. Make sure that you put the type as either "Event", "Chore", or "Reminder" in order for it to be displayed in our columns, because those are the types that we display.

In order to run the frontend please type "yarn frontend", in order to deploy the backend please type "yarn server", to run both concurrently, please type "yarn start".
